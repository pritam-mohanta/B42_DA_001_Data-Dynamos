# Data Analysis and Visualization with Streamlit

## Project Overview
This project is a data analysis and visualization application built using Streamlit. The dataset used for analysis is a solar power dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing 34 days of data recorded at 15-minute intervals. The objective of this project is to explore and visualize key trends in solar power generation over time.

### Objectives:
- Load and process the solar power dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.
- Create interactive visualizations using Streamlit.
- Provide a user-friendly dashboard for viewing key statistics and trends.

## Running the Streamlit Application Locally

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (if used in visualizations)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open the displayed URL in your web browser to interact with the application.

## Dashboard and Key Insights
The dashboard consists of the following sections:

1. **Overview Section:**
   - Displays general information about the dataset.
   - Shows basic statistics (e.g., average power generation, total energy produced).

2. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - Visualizes power generation trends over time.
   - Includes interactive date range filters.

3. **Daily and Hourly Trends:**
   - Analyzes variations in power generation throughout the day.
   - Identifies peak production hours.

4. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Allows comparison of different days or weeks to identify patterns.

5. **Customizable Data Filters:**
   - Users can filter the dataset based on specific parameters.

### Screenshots
*(Include screenshots of the dashboard here to illustrate the interface and insights.)*

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the dataset file (`solar_data.csv` or equivalent) is placed in the appropriate directory.
- The code is modular and can be extended to include additional visualizations.
- Future improvements may include forecasting models and more advanced analytics.
