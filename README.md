## 🚀 Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based dashboard designed to analyze and visualize data from a solar power plant. The dashboard provides insights into power generation, weather conditions, and efficiency metrics. It is built to help users explore trends, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Features
- **Interactive Date Selection**: Users can select a date range to filter and analyze data.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Displays critical metrics such as total DC/AC power, ambient/module temperature, and irradiation.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Power distribution (AC and DC) using pie charts.
  - Correlation heatmap for weather and generation data.
  - Time-series trends for DC/AC power and daily yield.
  - Efficiency and power loss analysis.
  - Impact of temperature on power generation.
- **Customizable KPIs**: Users can select specific KPIs to display based on their interests.
- **Enhanced UI**: Styled with custom CSS for a professional and visually appealing interface.

## How to Run the Application Locally

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Required Python libraries: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`.

## Deployment Information
The application is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** and can be accessed via the following link:

🔗 **https://soloar-power-plant-analysis.streamlit.app/**

## Additional Notes
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - The data is cleaned and merged before analysis.
  - Missing or invalid values are handled appropriately.
- **Customization**:
  - Users can modify the code to include additional KPIs or visualizations.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - The app uses Streamlit’s caching mechanism (`@st.cache_data`) to improve performance.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple plants or datasets.
- Include **machine learning models** for predictive analysis.
- Enable **data export functionality** for further analysis.
